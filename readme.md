# FALCON

The name Falcon was used for this project due to it being the first name ELON MUSK gave to his SpaceX first rocket.


## ELON MUSK

The Falcon programming language is a not-so-capable programming language that was developed as a side project. It is capable of performing BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS for now and would be updated shortly after the official release if "wisdom" gets back his mojo for it, lol (for now, use it to learn).

It is made up of:
- Interpreter, which is called Merlin (SpaceX's first main engine, I think; do well to research that later).
- Parser, which is called The Hulk.
- Lexer, which is called Kamui.

It also has other components (feel free to explore).

Let's go! All that is needed right now is nothing but the Python programming language, and you could learn how to download and set it up.

## Usage (Falcon lang)

### How to run:

ON LINUX:

```python3 shell.py```


Other platforms will be out (maybe...).

Syntax:
This is quite easy to use and set up; it is similar to the basic Python shell and works pretty much the same.

To add, multiply, divide, subtract, just type your digits:
``` 1 + 1 ```
```1 * 1 ```
```2 / 1 ```
```3 - 1 ```

Other functions one can do include setting variables. To do that, the set keyword is used:
``` set var = 12 ```

To use the if statement:
```if <expression> do <statement> elif <expression> do <statement>...else do <statement>```

For while:
``` while <expression> do <statement> ```

This project was done with the knowledge I got from Aaron (sorry buddy, I didn't get your name spelling right).

I learned a lot from this small project, ranging from binary trees to DSA, how computers work, and so much more.

I was aided by DAMI, AYO, AND CRYPTOKELLZ; they helped me in fixing the bugs I faced while building.

Well, that's a wrap.

I am Wisdom, the author of this project, and I am...
